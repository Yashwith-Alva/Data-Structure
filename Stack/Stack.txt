Uses LIFO: Last In Fist Out

OPERATIONS:
push(), pop(), isEmpty(), peek()

Time-Complexity for all operations is O(1).

Types of Stack:
1. Register Stack: The height of this stack is limited and can handle few data only.
2. Memory Stack: Can handle a large amount of memory data. The height of memory stack is flexible as 
                 it occupies a large amount of memory data.

Application of stack:
1. Balancing of Symbols
2. Infix, Postfix and Prefix
3. Redo-undo features in editor or photoshop
4. Forward and Backward feature in Web-Browser
5. Backtracking
6. Memory Management uses stack as it's primary management for running purpose
7. String Reversal
8. Matching tags in HTML and XML

Advantages of Stack:
1. Linked List implementation of stack can grow and shrink according to the needs at runtime.
2. It is used in many virtual machines like JVM.
3. Stacks are more secure and reliable as they do not get corrupted easily.
4. Stack cleans up the objects automatically.

Disadvantages of Stack:
1. Requires extra money due to involvement of pointers.
2. Random accessing is not possible in stack.
3. The total size of stack must be defined before.
4. If stack falls outside memory it can lead to abnormal termination.
