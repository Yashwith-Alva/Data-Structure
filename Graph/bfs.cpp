/**
 * @file bfs.cpp
 * @brief Breadth First Search
 *  Unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again.
 * To avoid processing a node more than once, we divide the vertices into two categories:
 *  1. Visited      2. Not visited
 *
 * BFS uses Queue for traversal
