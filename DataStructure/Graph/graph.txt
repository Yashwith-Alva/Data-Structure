A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting nodes and edges. The nodes are also referred to as vertices and edges are the point connecting nodes.
Graph consist of 2 components:
    1. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes
    2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form(u, v) called as edge. {(u,v) is not the same as (v, u)}

Representation of matrix:
    1. Adjacency matrix
    2. Adjacency List
